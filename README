A very very simple software rasterizer.

Parts of it (the model loader and the model, mostly) are from a
computer graphics class I took at some point. I removed all of the
C++yness, though, because eh.

It's missing some things, such as clipping in view space - it's 
fine as long as you don't have things really close or at infinity
or behind the camera.

To compile:

make

Needs OpenGL and GLUT and GLU, not for rasterizing, just for
getting a window on screen to show the results in.
